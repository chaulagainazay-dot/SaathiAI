# SaathiOS Autonomous Roadmap

Detected state: branch milestone/m7-security-engine, HEAD 1feb928 (M17.7, four
live apps: FFmpeg/SQLite/jq/zip). Priorities checked this invocation: no open
Critical/High (critical_checks green, red-team 81/81); release blockers are all
environment-blocked (authenticated browser, live approval click, staging
deploy+rollback — need credentials/deploy). Highest ready-now, non-filler gap is
therefore real validation + reliability of an already-built layer.

## Candidate scoring (this invocation)
| candidate | priority | notes | ready-now |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **M17.8 long-running harness task control** | #3/#4 | top "actionable without approval" real-debt item; cancel + orphan-free timeout kill + LIVE resource-limit enforcement + durable run journal w/ crash reconciliation; reuses the sole adapter (no second execution engine); no install/permission/credential | **5** |
| production monitoring/alerting | #4 | valuable but medium/large; less bounded for one iteration | 3 |
| AI Studio multi-harness pipeline | #5 | chains live apps; valuable but broader; do after execution reliability is proven | 3 |
| authenticated browser workflow | #5 | needs a safe staging credential (blocked) | 1 |
| native Finder/TextEdit actuation | — | macOS TCC permission required (blocked) | 0 |
| workflow intelligence engine | #6 | large; risks a second execution engine; premature | 1 |
| another system-utility harness | — | explicitly out — would only inflate app count | 0 |

## Decision (this invocation)
Priority chain says: no Critical/High open, release blockers environment-blocked →
take the highest-value ready-now "real validation of an already-built capability"
that also advances "long-session stability / crash recovery". → **M17.8 governed
long-running harness task control**. Bounded, reuses the one adapter boundary, and
is fully live-validatable (real cancel, real SIGXFSZ resource kill, real crash
reconciliation). Turns the top actionable real-debt item from "designed" to
"live-proven".

## Blocked / deferred (need user action or larger scope)
- authenticated browser / cloud connector workflow — needs a safe staging account.
- native Finder/TextEdit actuation — macOS Accessibility (TCC) not granted.
- GUI harness apps (LibreOffice/Blender/Kdenlive) — not installed.
- staging deploy + live rollback drill — needs a deploy target (no push/deploy).
- pause/resume/checkpoint, workflow intelligence, production monitoring — larger,
  next candidates once a deploy/credential path or a bounded design exists.
